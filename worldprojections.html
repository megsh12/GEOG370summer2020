    <h1>QGIS and Projections - a GEOG 370 project</h1>
    
    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2> -->
    <p>To display different projections in QGIS, you have to change the project coordinate reference system (CRS) in project properties. This can be accessed by pressing the current ESPG or ESRI number in the right corner, or 'project' then 'properties' on the top menu bar. You then select the desired CRS using either the authority ID or CRS name. This applies the CRS to the project, creating different projections. </p>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is an equidistant azimuthal projection, meaning direction and distance are preserved. Size and shape are distored, particularly towards the edge of the projection. All meridians are straight, with the center point defined as the North Pole. This style of projection is used in the UN logo.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel Tripel Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map aims to minimise distortion of area, distance and direction by averaging the Aitoff and equirectangular projection. Distortion increases towards the edges, away from the central meridian. Polar areas are particularly exaggerated. It is used by National Geographic.</h3>

    <h2>Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a conformal projection. Direction, angles and shapes are preserved - this is because the projection was originally designed for navigation. Shape is distored, particularly towards the poles. Greenland is a key example, appearing equal in size to Africa despite an actual 14-fold difference in size.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo (web) Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is a varient of the Mercator projection, featured directly above, used mainly in web mapping. Angles and distances are preserved, making it a useful tool for navigation. However, size is often distorted. It differs from the standard Mercator projection as it uses spherical formulae, whereas elliptical formulae are used in the standard Mercator projection.</h3>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is an equal area projection, though shape is often greatly distorted. This is exaggerated closer to the poles. There is great distortion of scale close to polar regions, too.</h3>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>In this conic projection, distance is preserved along meridians. Shape, angles and area are distorted, increasingly so towards the edges of the projection.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Craster Parabolic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This is an equivalent, or equal-area, projection. Shape is distoreted, particularly closer to the edge of the projection due to a significant bulge. The central medidian is around half the length of the equator, creating points at each pole.</h3>

    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2> -->
    <!-- <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3> -->
